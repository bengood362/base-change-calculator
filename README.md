# base-change-calculator
a base-change-calculator for myself to reference only.
it can print out the steps when changing base, and I use it to hand in my homework :)

## features
This program provides customizable base codes, for example, normal hex would be "0123456789ABCDEF", however you cna change them to "QWERTYUIOPASDFGH".  
This program also provides customizable dp for base-10.

## future development
* divide them into stateless functions
* dp for result
* flag for showing steps, showing answer

## note
* result will only be rounded down whenever it stops
